# GitHub bulk issue creator

Bulk opens batches of issues (or posts comments) across GitHub repositories based on a template and CSV of values. Think of it like "mail merge" for GitHub issues.

## How it works

1. You create a CSV of repositories where you'd like issues opened and any fill-in fields you'd like to include in the resulting issues. It might look something like this:

2. You create a template of what you'd like to use as the basis for the resulting issue body. You can even reference those per-issue fill-in fields. If we wanted to reference the `name` field in the example above, it might look something like this:<br />

3. You run the bulk issue creator script (either locally or via GitHub Actions - see below)
4. Customized issues are created on your behalf for every row you defined in the CSV.
5. Profit! :tada:

## Running locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/benbalter/bulk-issue-creator`
2. `bulk-issue-creator init` to create a `./config/data.csv` and `./config/template.md.mustache` files
3. Follow [the "Setup" instructions below](#setup) to customize the data file and template.
4. Export the personal access token you create as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environmental variable, or add it to a `.env` file in the root of the repository in the form of `GITHUB_TOKEN=XXX`.
5. Run `bulk-issue-creator` to preview the output
6. Run `bulk-issue-creator --write` to create the issues.

## Running via GitHub actions

Don't want to deal with the hassle of setting up a local Ruby environment? No worries. With a little copy/paste can use GitHub actions to open issues *from the cloud!*:

1. Create a new repository (public or private)
2. Follow [the "Setup" instructions below](#setup) to add the CSV and template to the repository.
3. Store the personal access token you create as the `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` [Actions Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) within the repository settings
4. Create a `.github/workflows/bulk-issue-creator.yml` file with the following contents:
    ```yml
    on: 
      workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
          write:
            description: "Change to 'true' to create issues, leave as 'false' to preview output"
            default: "false"
            type: boolean

    name: Bulk issue creator

    jobs:
      bulk_issue_creator:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Bulk Issue Creator
        steps:
          - name: Checkout template and data
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Create bulk issues
            uses: benbalter/bulk-issue-creator@main
            with: 
              write: ${{ github.event.inputs.write }}
              comment: ${{ github.event.inputs.comment }}
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    ```
5. Navigate to `Actions` -> `Bulk issue creator` -> `Run Workflow` and click `Run Workflow` to preview the output.

    Note: once you run the workflow, you can see the output by clicking `Bulk issue creator` in the side bar, and then clicking into the most recent run.

    ![Example preview output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/282759/115309886-e65d9580-a13a-11eb-8211-7db724c6127a.png)
6. Repeat step 5, changing the `false` text input to `true` in the final dialog to create issues.

## Setup

1. Run `bulk-issue-creator init` or manually create a CSV file in `./config/data.csv`. The CSV must have columns for `repository` and `title` (for issues) or `issue_number` (for comments). All field names are case sensitive. You can also add any other columns you would like, which will be available to the template. It should look something like this:
    ```csv
    repository,title,project,labels
    benbalter/gman,Update GMan,GMan,"Red,Blue"
    benbalter/jekyll-auth,Update Jekyll Auth,Jekyll Auth,"Green,Blue"
    ```
2. Edit (or create) the `./config/template.md.mustache` file in the same directory with the content you want in the issue body. You can reference CSV fields like `{{project}}` using the [Mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html). It should look something like this:
    ```mustache
    Hey there! It looks like it's time to update {{project}}!
    ```
3. [Create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `repo` scope.

### Templating

Templates (and issue titles) support the [Mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html). Field names in the CSV should be lower case, and should use `_`s to separate multiple words `like_this`, instead of spaces.

### Advanced usage

#### Additional command line arguments

```
Options:
  [--write], [--no-write]                    # Write issues to GitHub, defaults to preview only
  [--comment], [--no-comment]                # Create comments instead of issues
  [--template-path=TEMPLATE_PATH]            # Path to the template file
  [--csv-path=CSV_PATH]                      # Path to the CSV file
  [--add-to-project], [--no-add-to-project]  # Add newly created issues to a project (beta) project
```

#### Special fields

* You can add a `labels` or `assignees` column to the CSV, with a comma-separated list of labels or assignees that you'd like added to the issue.
* You can add an `issue_number` column to the CSV, with the issue number you'd like the comment added to. Note: You must pass the `--comment` flag

#### Adding issues to a project board

If you'd like to add created issues to a project board, I suggest adding a specific label and using [`actions/add-to-project`](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project) to add the issue to the project board.
